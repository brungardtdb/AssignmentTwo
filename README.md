# AssignmentTwo
This application calculates the age a user will retire based on input from the user. I decided to make things fun and make the assignment more complicated than it probably needed to be, so I added an interface and an abstract class and decided to try out some inheritance (something I've never attempted in Java before). I discovered that Java has packages, not namespaces, and the syntax for inheriting other classes, interfaces, etc. is a little different from my native tongue (C#). I also learned a new command line command to create those packages in Java (javac -d . className.java), and had a lot of fun writing all of this code and learning Java!
-Just a note for anybody reading this: the "Main" method is in Operation2. RetirementCalculator is the class used by Operation2 to make the calculation and it inherits the ICalculate interface and the Calculator abstract class.
